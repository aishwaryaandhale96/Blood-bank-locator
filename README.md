# BloodBankLocator
In emergency situations, finding the nearest blood bank with the required blood type 
and sufficient stock can be a critical task. Traditional methods of searching for blood 
banks are often slow and inefficient, leading to critical delays. Additionally, managing 
reservations and payments for blood units adds another layer of complexity, which 
can be overwhelming in urgent scenarios. There is a need for a streamlined, realtime solution that can efficiently connect blood recipients with blood banks, ensuring 
that life-saving blood transfusions can be secured quickly and easily. This project 
aims to address these challenges by developing a comprehensive application that 
facilitates the entire process, from locating the nearest blood bank to completing the
transaction seamlessly.
